### Written by Jansen Yan ###
### For CS 146 ###

### Purpose ###

Given filenames as arguments, print M Lines out of every N

### Usage ###

$ every [-N,M] [<list-of-files>]

M and N must be positive, and M <= N

Additional: 
if M is not given, it will be defaulted to 1

if no files are give, every will read from stdin

if no -N,M is given but list of files are given,
every will get the -N,M from an environment variable $EVERY,

$EVERY must be defined like so in the bash profile, where N and M are 
the numbers:

export EVERY=-N,M
